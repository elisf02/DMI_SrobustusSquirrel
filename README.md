code to reproduce the results of: "SILENT ENEMIES: SUBLETHAL MACROPARASITES CAN DRIVE DISEASE-MEDIATED INVASIONS"

The code includes 4 files: 
1) "Main.R": the main code to reproduce the simulations of the scenarios
2) "Sensitivity.R"": the main code for the sensitivity analysis

3) "Functions/DetMod.R": the funciton for the deterministic model
4) "Functions/Parameters.R": the file with the parameters

You need the four of them to reproduce the same set of simulations

There is an additional file (Plots.R) to produce the plots as they are reported in the paper.
